/**
 * Everything that happens inside this meter, as it happens.
 *
 * The entries arrive over one Server-Sent Events stream and go in at the top,
 * newest first, so the line worth reading is the one that is already on screen;
 * the filters work on what is already in the browser, so changing one costs
 * nothing and asks the meter for nothing. A list that is scrolled to the top
 * follows along; scrolling down stops that, which is what somebody reading an
 * older line wants - and the button brings them back.
 *
 * This is the page to watch while something is going wrong. Its twin under
 * /metrological-log reads the same entries as a record rather than as news,
 * and can say whether the copy on disk is still intact.
