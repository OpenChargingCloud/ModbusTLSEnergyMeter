// counter on the station, and the counter only ever grows - so an entry is
// taken only when it is newer than the snapshot, and a replayed stream (Hermod
// repeats its cached events to every new client) does no harm.
//
// The stream is not filtered: the snapshot and the events have to be about the
// same thing, or a filter changed at the browser would leave holes that only
// another round trip could fill. Filtering by tag and by level happens on this
// side, over what is already here, and is therefore instant.
