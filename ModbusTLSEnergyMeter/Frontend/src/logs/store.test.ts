 *
 * What is pinned is what was measured to be wrong: a session ended while the
 * page was open, the stream was cut, and the browser's retry then got a 401 -
 * which it treats as final. The page went on saying "reconnecting ..." over a
 * frozen list, with the meter up and running and the operator signed out
 * without being told. The charging station's tests, whose station found it
 * after a restart; this meter keeps its sessions across one.
